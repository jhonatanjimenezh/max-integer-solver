/**
 * Configuration class for Use Cases in the application.
 * This class uses Spring's {@link ComponentScan} to specify which packages to scan for Spring beans.
 * Specifically, it is configured to scan the 'application.usecase' package for components that adhere to the Use Case naming convention.
 *
 * <p>This approach allows for a more modular and organized structure, ensuring that only the necessary components
 * related to the use cases are registered as Spring beans.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note: The use of custom filters here is to maintain adherence to the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles,
 * where only classes named with 'UseCase' suffix are considered for dependency injection.</p>
